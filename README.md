## Components of the Chef Server

This repository contains the core services that make up the Chef Server.

```
|-- oc-chef-pedant: A comprehensive test suite for the Chef Server API
|-- omnibus: Omnibus build configuration for the Chef Server
|-- scripts: Utility scripts
`-- src
    |-- bookshelf: S3-compatible engine for storing cookbook data
    |-- chef-mover: data migration orchestrator used in upgrades
    |-- oc-id: OAuth2 provider for extensions like Analytics or Supermarket
    |-- oc_bifrost: Chef Server's authorization service
    |-- oc_erchef: The core REST API server
    |-- chef-server-ctl: The Chef Server's command line management utility
```

## Working on the Chef Server

The quickest way to get a Chef Server development environment is to
follow the [instructions](https://github.com/chef/chef-server/blob/master/dev/README.md) in the `dev` directory.
This environment is based on Vagrant and features hot reloading of code.

## Building a Chef Server package locally:

You can build a Chef Server package locally with vagrant and test-kitchen.

```shell
cd omnibus/
make dev dev-build
```

Once the build is complete, the package should be in omnibus/pkg. By default the dev-build target will create an Ubuntu 10.04 build.

## Habitized Chef Server

The following components now exist as Habitat packages and are available [here](https://bldr.habitat.sh/#/origins/chef-server/packages):
- nginx
- bookshelf
- oc_id
- oc_erchef
- oc_bifrost
- chef-server-ctl

To build the packages locally:

```shell
./habitat_pkgs_build.sh
```

A top-level `docker-compose.yml` file exists for running Chef Server from Habitized Docker images:

```shell
docker-compose down && docker system prune --volumes -f && docker-compose up
```

Running pedant tests:

```shell
docker-compose exec chef-server-ctl chef-server-test
```

Running chef-server-ctl:

```shell
docker-compose exec chef-server-ctl chef-server-ctl command (subcommands)
```

## Dependencies contained in other repositories

- [knife-ec-backup](https://www.github.com/chef/knife-ec-backup), used to ease migrations from Open Source Chef Server 11 (and below)
- [knife-opc](https://www.github.com/chef/knife-opc), used to provide administrative command-line control to the Chef Server from the console

## Major Technologies used in Chef Server

- Erlang
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Elasticsearch
- Nginx (openresty with lpeg library addition)
- Runit for service supervision

If you're looking to contribute to certain parts of the Chef server, familiarity with the following related tools is also beneficial, depending on the area.

- rebar (used for dependency management in Erlang)
- sqitch (database migrations)
- lua (routing rules in openresty)

## Chef Expeditor

The `chef/chef-server` repository, like many other Chef Software
repositories, leverages an internal utility called Chef Expeditor to
create a pub-sub model of actions across our various CI/CD utilities.
